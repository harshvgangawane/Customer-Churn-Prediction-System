# Customer-Churn-Prediction-System
Problem Statement:
It is just as easy to lose customers as to acquire them in todayâ€™s telecommunications market. In the race to acquire new users, keeping customers may be as equally pressing as acquiring new ones to lower customer churn, which occurs when customers leave a service entirely. Losing customers can have a huge revenue impact and possible future opportunities for long term sales growth.
Telecom companies must proactively identify customers at risk of churning and implement retention strategies.

Solution Proposed:
This project aims to build a machine learning-based Customer Churn Prediction System that uses historical customer data to predict the likelihood of churn. The goal is to assist business teams in identifying high-risk customers early and taking data-driven decisions to retain them.
